# Sample grid-based game

Based on https://hkmg.itch.io/an-elephants-journey-to-find-its-mate

How to use:

- The first time you open this, run `npm install`
- Every time you want to work on it, run `npm run dev`
- To publish, run `npm run update` (you'll need to set up [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/))
    - If you don't want to set up butler, just run `npm run build`, zip up the generated `/dist/` folder, and upload it using itch's web interface
    - It is also published on your username.github.io page, if you set it up.
